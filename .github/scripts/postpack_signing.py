"""Stage and write back the executables `vpk pack` generates, signed after packing.

Ported unchanged in logic from PerformanceMonitor, where it was added in its #3288.

WHY THIS RUNS AFTER PACKING RATHER THAN INSIDE IT

  Velopack generates three executables during `vpk pack` -- the portable launcher stub,
  `Update.exe` (`Squirrel.exe` under its internal name) and `Setup.exe`. They do not exist when
  the pre-pack signing rounds run, so those rounds cannot reach them.

  Signing them from inside packing is not available either. SignPath's open-source signing
  policy requires origin verification through a trusted build system: a request is accepted only
  through `signpath/github-action-submit-signing-request`, which attests repository, branch,
  commit and build-job URL. That is a workflow step, and a workflow step cannot be invoked from
  inside a running `vpk pack`. A raw API-token submission carries no attestation and the policy
  answers 403.

  So the two standalone assets are signed by an Action step after packing. `Setup.exe` and
  `Portable.zip` carry no recorded hash: `releases.<channel>.json` records a SHA256 and a Size
  for the two `.nupkg` files and nothing else, so rewriting the standalone assets invalidates
  nothing. The copies of the stub and `Squirrel.exe` inside the `.nupkg` stay unsigned, two per
  product, and they are the only executables a release publishes without a signature. They are
  allowlisted by member path AND container in verify_release_signatures.py, so the same two
  names anywhere else still fail its guard.

WHAT IT SIGNS, AND HOW IT FINDS THEM

  Per product directory: the single `*-Setup.exe`, and every `.exe` at the ROOT of the single
  `*Portable.zip`. The root entries are the deployed launcher and `Update.exe`; the signed app
  payload sits one level down in `current/` and is not resubmitted.

  The root rule is positional, not by name, because the launcher is named after the Velopack
  pack id rather than the application's own executable: Performance Studio's portable zip's root
  entry is `PerformanceStudio.exe` while the application is `PlanViewer.App.exe` and lives at
  `current/`.

THE PORTABLE ZIP IS A SHIPPED ARTIFACT

  So `apply` rebuilds it member by member rather than re-creating it. Every member that is not
  replaced keeps its local header, name, extra field and raw compressed bytes verbatim; the
  central directory keeps every field except the local-header offsets, which shift. The two
  replaced members are re-deflated with the original compression method. `apply` then reopens
  the result and asserts that property before the rebuilt zip replaces the original: identical
  entry names in identical order, identical per-entry metadata, byte-identical raw members
  except the replaced ones, and identical decompressed content except the replaced ones.

USAGE

  python postpack_signing.py collect --stage DIR --manifest FILE --product studio=releases/velopack

  python postpack_signing.py apply --signed DIR --manifest FILE

  python postpack_signing.py --self-test

  Exit status is 0 on success and 1 on any failure. There is no partial success: `apply` reads
  and signature-checks the entire signing response, then builds and verifies every product's
  rebuilt archive, and only then writes anything into the packed output.
