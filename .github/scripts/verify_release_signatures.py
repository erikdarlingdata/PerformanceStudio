"""Report which published Windows executables carry an Authenticode signature.

Ported unchanged in logic from PerformanceMonitor, where it was added in its #3288.

Every executable `vpk pack` GENERATES shipped unsigned on every Performance Studio release
through v1.28.0 -- the portable launcher stub, `Update.exe`, and `Setup.exe` -- while the app
payload was signed. PerformanceMonitor had the same gap in v3.6.0 and v3.7.0. It goes
unnoticed because the only visible symptom is a Windows "unknown publisher"
block on someone else's machine, and because nothing asked the question.

So this asks it, from any platform: is there a signature attached to each thing a user can
launch. `--verify-dir` asks it of artifacts still on disk in the release job, which is the step
that refuses to publish. The tag form asks it of what a release actually shipped.

WHAT IT CHECKS, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT

  It reads the PE optional header's Security data directory (index 4) and reports whether the
  certificate table is non-empty. That is "a signature is attached" and nothing more.

  It does NOT verify the signature: not the chain, not trust, not the timestamp, not revocation,
  not whether the digest matches the file. Doing that properly needs a Windows trust store, and
  the defect actually shipped twice was TOTAL ABSENCE -- offset 0, size 0 -- which this catches
  for free. Read a pass as "signed", never as "correctly signed".

  It only understands PE files. A NuGet package signature, an MSIX catalog, or a detached
  signature file are all invisible to it.

  Executables inside a published archive are checked too, because the one that matters most is
  inside one: the portable zip's ROOT `PerformanceStudio.exe` is a 397 kB launcher shim,
  while the signed 180 kB app sits in `current/`. A check that only looked at top-level assets
  would have passed every affected release.

  Two executables are allowed to be unsigned, and only in one place each: `lib/app/*_ExecutionStub.exe`
  and `lib/app/Squirrel.exe` INSIDE a `.nupkg`. `releases.<channel>.json` records a SHA256 and a
  Size for each `.nupkg`, the delta package patches against those bytes, and `vpk pack` is what
  writes that manifest -- so re-signing a member of a `.nupkg` invalidates it. The copies of the
  same two files that ship in `Portable.zip` carry no recorded hash and ARE signed, and the
  allowance is keyed on the container as well as the member path so those copies, and a
  same-named file anywhere else, still fail. See ALLOWED_UNSIGNED.

COST, because it is why this is runnable rather than theoretical

  It never downloads a whole artifact. For each standalone `.exe` it fetches the first 4 kB to
  locate the certificate table, then that table's byte range. For each archive it fetches the
  end-of-central-directory record, the central directory, and then only the entries that are
  executables. In PerformanceMonitor, checking v3.7.0's five Lite assets moved a few MB rather
  than the ~370 MB those assets total.

  This relies on the asset host honouring HTTP Range. GitHub release downloads do. If a host
  ignores Range and returns the whole body, the reads still succeed and it merely costs what a
  download would -- it does not silently check the wrong bytes, because a short or unexpected
  read raises rather than being interpreted.

USAGE

  python .github/scripts/verify_release_signatures.py v1.28.0
  python .github/scripts/verify_release_signatures.py v1.28.0 --json
  python .github/scripts/verify_release_signatures.py --verify-dir releases/velopack
  python .github/scripts/verify_release_signatures.py --self-test

  Exit status is 1 if any executable is unsigned and not covered by ALLOWED_UNSIGNED, 2 if a
  release, asset or directory could not be read at all, and 0 otherwise. An empty executable
  list is status 2, not 0: finding nothing to check is a broken run, not a clean one.

  `--verify-dir` is the release guard: the same reader over artifacts that are still on disk
  before upload, so it needs no HTTP and no published release. The tag form answers "what did we
  actually publish", which is the question that goes unasked. Both apply ALLOWED_UNSIGNED.
